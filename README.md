## üìù Project Overview 

As part of my internship at CodTech, I completed Task 4: Optimization Model, which involved solving a real-world business problem using linear programming techniques in Python. The project focused on optimizing furniture production to maximize profits under limited resources. Specifically, a furniture company manufactures Chairs and Tables, where each Chair yields a profit of ‚Çπ50 and each Table yields ‚Çπ60. The production of these items requires a limited supply of Wood (100 units) and Labor Hours (120 hours). A Chair consumes 2 units of wood and 3 labor hours, while a Table consumes 3 units of wood and 2 labor hours. The goal was to determine the optimal number of Chairs and Tables to produce to achieve the highest profit.

To solve this optimization problem, I used Python 3.13 along with the PuLP library, which is widely used for linear and integer programming. The problem was formulated with decision variables representing the number of Chairs and Tables, an objective function to maximize profit, and constraints for wood and labor resources. I created both a .py script and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), allowing the solution to be understood in both code and interactive formats. The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for scripting and testing.

Once the model was executed, the optimal solution indicated that producing 32 Chairs and 12 Tables would yield the maximum profit of ‚Çπ2320, staying within the resource constraints. The output confirms that the status of the solution is Optimal, and the model satisfies all the defined constraints. Screenshots of this result were taken from the terminal and Jupyter Notebook outputs and included in the project for visual reference.

This task not only deepened my understanding of operations research concepts but also demonstrated the practical use of optimization in industries like manufacturing, logistics, and resource planning. It showcases how mathematical modeling and Python libraries like PuLP can be effectively used to make informed business decisions. Both the script (.py) and interactive notebook (.ipynb) are included in the repository for easy access and reference.
